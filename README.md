# **What is Requirement Analysis?** #

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) when the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software to  be developed.

# **Importance of Requirement Analysis** #

Scope Definition:Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.

Clarity and Understanding:  It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.

Basic for Design and Development:  Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.

Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.

Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# **Key Activities in Requirements Analysis** #

  -  Requirements Gathering

      -  Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.

      - Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.

      -  Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.

      -  Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.

      -  Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

  -  Requirement Elicitation

      -  Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.

      -  Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.

       -  Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

  -  Requirement Documentation
      -  Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.

      -  User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the userâ€™s perspective.

      -  Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

  -  Requirement Analysis
      -  Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.

      -  Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.

      -  Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

  -  Requirement Validation
      -  Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

      -  Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
      -  Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

# **Types of Requirements** #
1.  Functional Requirements

2.  Non-functional Requirements

    * Functional Requirements: It gives comprehensive details what a system should do.

      Examples: Hotel Management Service, Customer Service, and View Booking Service.

    *  Non-functional requirements: It tells us how a system should perform.

       Examples: Handling of hotel's related information, create customers' portal to access the data and process it, and To show current and old booking details to the user.

# **Use Case Diagrams** #

Use case diagrams are visual representation of interactions between users and the system.

## **Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

    -  Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities
    -  Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
    -  Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development.
